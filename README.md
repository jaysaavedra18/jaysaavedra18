- 👋 Hi, I’m Jason
- 👀 I’m interested in all things coding, programming, and computer science
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing up my B.S. in Computer Science at Purdue University part-time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to begin entry-level work in programming while completing my degree.
- 👨‍💻 My experience in Object-Oriented Programming like Java and more Structural Level Programming like C makes me excited to apply my skills hands on.
